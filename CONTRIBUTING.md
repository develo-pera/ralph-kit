# Contributing to ralph-kit

Thanks for your interest in ralph-kit. This guide covers how to get set up, how to structure changes, and what we expect from a PR.

**Every contribution matters** — fixing a typo, tightening a type, or shipping a whole new command. Small, focused changes are easier to review and ship than big ones.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — required runtime.
- **npm** — ships with Node.
- **git** — version control.

Optional, but helpful:
- A project with a `.ralph/` directory to point the dashboard at, or use the built-in `fixtures/demo` fixture.

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ralph-kit.git
cd ralph-kit
npm install
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Type-check, tests, production build — all three should be clean
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

You should see 17/17 tests passing and a successful build.

### Run It Locally

```bash
# One-shot: Express API + Vite dev server with HMR
# (Express defaults to fixtures/demo; override with RALPH_KIT_DEV_DIR=/path)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Edit any `.tsx` / `.css` in `web/src/` and the browser updates instantly.

To test the production path (Express serving the built bundle):

```bash
npm run build
npm run board   # runs tsx against fixtures/demo by default
```

## Development Workflow

We use **GitHub Flow**: short-lived feature branches, every change lands on `main` via pull request. Nothing is committed directly to `main`.

### Branch Naming

| Kind | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feat/<slug>` | `feat/dark-mode-toggle` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<slug>` | `fix/port-conflict-message` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<slug>` | `refactor/promote-atomics` |
| Docs | `docs/<slug>` | `docs/contributing-guide` |
| Tests | `test/<slug>` | `test/backlog-parser-edges` |
| Chore | `chore/<slug>` | `chore/bump-vite` |

```bash
git switch -c feat/my-change
```

### Workflow

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode is on.** No `any` unless there's a genuine reason; prefer `unknown` + narrowing.
- **CommonJS output** (`module: node16`). Source uses ES-style `import`; tsc emits `require`.
- **No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious.** Don't restate what the code does; explain hidden constraints, workarounds, or behavior that would surprise a reader. Identifiers should carry the meaning.
- **No dead abstractions.** Don't introduce helpers, layers, or feature flags for hypothetical future requirements.
- **Validate at boundaries, not internally.** Trust your own code; validate request bodies, filesystem input, user input.

### React

- Function components + hooks. No class components.
- Local state in `useState`; side effects in `useEffect`. Lift state only when needed.
- Accessibility over cleverness — use native `<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<label>`, etc. before rolling custom.
- Styling: CSS variables against the shadcn token scheme (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, etc.). Don't hardcode hex values in new components.

### Naming

- Files: `snake_case.ts` for lib modules (matches the pre-existing convention — `fix_plan_parser`, `backlog_parser`), `PascalCase.tsx` for React components, `camelCase.ts` for hooks.
- Exports: `camelCase` for values, `PascalCase` for types and React components.

### Imports

- Node built-ins use the `node:` prefix: `import fs from 'node:fs'`.
- Prefer named imports over default where the module offers them.
- Relative imports stay within `src/` or `web/src/`; no reaching across the two.

---

## Testing

Tests live next to the code they cover (`src/lib/*.test.ts`). We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```bash
npm test                # run once
npx vitest              # watch mode
npx vitest <pattern>    # run a single file or test
```

**What to test:**
- Parsers: round-trip (`parse(serialize(x)) === x`), edge cases (empty input, malformed lines).
- State transitions: `promote`, `demoteToBacklog`, etc. — use `fs.mkdtempSync` for isolated fixtures.
- Doctor: missing / uninitialized / initialized states.
- Bug fixes: add a regression test in the same PR.

**What not to test:**
- Static React rendering — visual regressions are better caught manually.
- Framework behavior (Express routing, Vite bundling) — that's their problem, not ours.

**CI enforces:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build` must all be green before a PR can merge.

## Pull Request Process

1. **One concern per PR.** If you find yourself writing "and also" in the description, it's probably two PRs.
2. **Keep PRs small.** ≤300 lines changed is reviewable in one sitting; bigger ones tend to stall.
3. **PR description** should explain:
   - What this PR does (one or two sentences).
   - Why — the problem or motivation.
   - How you verified it (manual steps, tests added, screenshots for UI).
4. **Link issues** with `Fixes #123` / `Closes #123` / `Refs #123`.
5. **CI must be green** before merge. If it's red and you think it's flaky, say so in the PR.
6. **Squash-merge** is the default. The PR title becomes the commit message — write it accordingly (conventional commits, imperative mood).

### Draft PRs

Open as a draft while work is in progress. Mark it ready when you want review.

### Self-review first

Before requesting review, open your own PR on GitHub and read the diff top-to-bottom. Half the feedback you'd get from someone else is feedback you'd catch yourself with fresh eyes.

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body — optional, wrap at 72>

<footer — optional: Closes #123, BREAKING CHANGE:, Co-Authored-By:>
```

### Types

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New user-visible functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Change that neither adds nor fixes behavior |
| `docs` | Docs only |
| `test` | Test-only changes |
| `chore` | Tooling, config, deps — nothing end-user-visible |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `style` | Whitespace / formatting only |

### Scope

Usually the area of the codebase: `web`, `server`, `lib`, `bin`, `readme`, `deps`. Omit if the change is cross-cutting.

### Writing good messages

- Imperative mood: "add", not "added" or "adds".
- Subject ≤72 chars. If you can't fit it, the PR is probably doing too much.
- Body explains **why**, not what — the diff already shows what.
- Reference issues in the footer.

### Examples

```
feat(web): add light/dark theme switching

fix(server): auto-increment port when default is in use

refactor: migrate bin, lib, server to TypeScript

docs(readme): link Ralph Loop reference to ghuntley.com/ralph
```

## Releases

Ralph-kit is published to npm. Release cadence is driven by meaningful changes, not a calendar.

### Versioning

We follow [semver](https://semver.org/):
- **patch** (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) — bug fixes, docs, internal refactors.
- **minor** (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) — new features, non-breaking additions.
- **major** (`0.1.0` → `1.0.0`) — breaking changes to the CLI, slash commands, or exported API.

### Cutting a release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions + npm Trusted Publisher (OIDC). From a clean `main`:

```bash
npm version patch        # or minor / major — bumps package.json, commits, tags vX.Y.Z
git push --follow-tags   # pushes the tag; CI does the rest
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. Runs typechecks + tests + build from a clean CI checkout.
2. Verifies the tag matches `package.json` version (safety net).
3. `npm publish --access public --provenance` — OIDC-authenticated, no tokens. Produces a signed provenance attestation visible on the npm page.
4. Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes from the PRs merged since the last tag.

No local `npm publish`, no long-lived tokens, no OTP dance. If CI is red, the publish doesn't happen.

### Rolling back

`npm unpublish <pkg>@<version>` works within 72 hours of publish. After that, cut a new patch version that reverts the offending change — rolling forward is the norm.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind, be specific, be direct. Disagree with ideas, not with people. If you catch yourself writing something you wouldn't say to a colleague's face, rewrite it. That's it.
